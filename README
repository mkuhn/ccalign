CCAlign -- Refined alignment of coiled coil proteins

CCAlign is based on JAligner (http://jaligner.sf.net), an open source Java 
implementation of the Smith-Waterman algorithm with Gotoh's improvement for
biological local pairwise sequence alignment with the affine gap penalty model.

This program makes use of coiled-coil predictions by MultiCoil2 and substitution
matrices created by a modified BLAST version.
